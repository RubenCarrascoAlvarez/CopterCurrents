function [distance, distance_x,distance_y, initial_point,end_point] = measure_distance_interactive(X_2D,Y_2D,IMG_2D,maximum_n_measures)
% Tool to measure distances in a interactive way. 
%
%   Follow the istructions on the figure.
%   1) Choose area by zoom and press spacer.
%   2) Rigth click mouse in the intial point.
%   3) Rigth click mouse in the end point.
%   4) distance is displayed:
%      option 1: close figure + press Spacer => to exit 
%      option 2: press Spacer => to try again until  maximum_n_measures is
%      reaceched.
%
%   Inputs:
%     X_2D: 2 dimensional X grid 
%     Y_2D: 2 dimensional Y grid 
%     IMG_2D: grey scale image corresponding to X_2D and Y_2D.
%     maximum_n_measures: maximum tries [inf]
%
%   Outputs:
%     distance: distance retrieved sqrt(x^2+y^2), only for last try.
%     distance_x: distance in X direction (Horizontal) retrieved, 
%                 only for last try.
%     distance_y: distance in Y direction (Vertical) retrieved, 
%                 only for last try.
%     initial_point: initial mouse click coordenates,only for last try.
%     end_point: end mouse click coordenates,only for last try.
