function [DATA_mean] = nanmean(DATA,dim)
% Retrieve the average in dimension 'dim' of the matrix 'DATA', ignoring the 
% NaN values. 
%
% Input:
%    DATA: matrix data
%    dim: dimension to average.
%
% Output:
%    DATA_mean: Average data.
%
% Note: this function is similar to the nanmean function provided by Matlab
%       in the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
%
