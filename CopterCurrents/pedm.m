%%%%%%%%% INPUTS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Units of inputs must be consistent, given as quantity in [...]

%k_vect - list of wavenumber values [rad/length]
%c_til - list of Doppler shift velocities at wavenumners k_vect [length/time]

%PEDM parameters (all positive values):
%nMax_vals %Polynomial order [unity]
%deltaz_T_vals %Depth interval (shallow end) for extrapolation [length]
%deltaz_B_vals %Depth interval (deep end) for extrapolation [length]

%If multiple values are given for the above PEDM parameters, the function will
%loop over all combinations. The outputs returned will reflect the
%parameter combination giving a minimum value of 'eps_PEDM', the RMS
%difference between 'c_til' and the forward calculated Doppler shifts based
%on the PEDM current profile. If no values are provided, the following
%defaults will be used:
%nMax_vals: (2:nm) where 'nm' is  min(12,round(numel(k_vect)/3)) 
%deltaz_T_vals: linspace(0.01,0.2,20)*depthRange where 'depthRange' is the range of mapped depths  
%deltaz_B_vals: linspace(0.02,0.8,20)*depthRange


%If nMax, deltaz_T, and/or deltaz_B contain multiple values, all parameter
%combinations will be run, with the outputs reflecting the combination with
%the smallest value of eps_PEDM.

%waterDepth (optional): water depth [length]. If not provided or [], infinite
%depth is assumed. %NOTE: this implementation of the PEDM has not been
%exclusively tested for cases of finite water depth. Use with some caution
%if min(k_vect*waterDepth)<pi (though it is expected to perform reasonably
%accurately for moderate depths - see above article for further details).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%% OUTPUTS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%pPEDM: polynomial coefficients of the PEDM profile (with minimum eps_PEDM)

%eps_PEDM: [length/time] RMS difference between c_til and forward calculated shifts based on PEDM profile
%eps_EDM: [length/time] RMS difference between c_til and forward calculated shifts based on EDM profile
