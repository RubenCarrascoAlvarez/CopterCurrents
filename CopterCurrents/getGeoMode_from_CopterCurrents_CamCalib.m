% Get the type of georeference to be used in the CopterCurrents_CamCalib structure
%
%   Input:
%       CopterCurrents_CamCalib: CopterCurrents Camera calibration structure.
%
%   Output:
%       GeoMode: 0 => Caltech or OpenCV georeferencing method.
%       GeoMode: 1 => FOV georeferencing method.

% GeoMode = 0 => 
%           CopterCurrents_CamCalib.fc: focal length in pixels, 2x1 vector.
%           CopterCurrents_CamCalib.cc: principal point coordinates, 2x1 vector.
%           CopterCurrents_CamCalib.Skew coefficient: The skew coefficient defining
%               the angle  between the x and y pixel axes, 1x1 scalar, 
%               normally 0.
%       CopterCurrents_CamCalib.Distortions: Image distortion coefficients
%           (radial and tangential distortions), 5x1 vector where:
%               kc(1) = k1 (radial distortion)
%               kc(2) = k2 (radial distortion)
%               kc(3) = p1 (tangencial distortion)
%               kc(4) = p2 (tangencial distortion)
%               kc(5) = k3 (radial distortion)
%       CopterCurrents_CamCalib.nx: number of sensor pixels in horizontal direction. 
%       CopterCurrents_CamCalib.ny: number of sensor pixels in vertical direction.
%       CopterCurrents_CamCalib.camera_offset_Z: distance in meters between the
%               camera and drone GPS antenna.
%       CopterCurrents_CamCalib.source: Calibration source used.
%
% GeoMode = 1 => 
%    CopterCurrents_CamCalib: camera configuration structure
%         CopterCurrents_CamCalib.fov_diag: diagonal field of view angle
%         CopterCurrents_CamCalib.fov_x : x (horizontal) field of view angle;
%         CopterCurrents_CamCalib.fov_y : y (vertical) field of view angle;
%         CopterCurrents_CamCalib.size_X : frame pixel size in x (horizontal);
%         CopterCurrents_CamCalib.size_Y : frame pixel size in y (vertical);
%         CopterCurrents_CamCalib.camera_offset_Z = vertical (Z) distance in meter
%                                          between GPS and camera;
