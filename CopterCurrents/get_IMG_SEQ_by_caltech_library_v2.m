function IMG_SEQ = get_IMG_SEQ_by_caltech_library_v2(Georeference_Struct_config,heading,pitch,roll,timestamp_video,Height_drone)
% Retrieve IMG_SEQ structure using the 'Camera Calibration Toolbox for Matlab'.
% The IMG_SEQ structure stores the video data in real size.
%   
%   Note: the caltech library 'Camera Calibration Toolbox for Matlab' is 
%   an external libary, written by Jean-Yves Bouguet,
%   jean-yves.bouguet@intel.com. This library is not part of CopterCurrents, and it
%   is available in:
%
%   http://www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib_doc/
%   
%   The 'Camera Calibration Toolbox for Matlab' is compatible with OpenCV
%   camera calibration. This is the main reason to include this function in
%   CopterCurrents.
%  
%   If you want to retrieve the IMG_SEQ structure without any CopterCurrents 
%   external library, then use 'get_IMG_SEQ_by_HZG_method.m'.
% 
%   Input:
%     Georeference_Struct_config: Georeference configuration 
%     heading: video metadata heading (yaw) in degrees 
%     pitch: video metadata pitch in degrees 
%     roll: video metadata roll in degrees 
%     timestamp_video: time video information in seconds
%     Height_drone: distance from camera to water surface in meters.
%
%   Output:
%     IMG_SEQ structure
%     IMG_SEQ.IMG: 3D Intensty data (Nx,Ny,Nt)
%     IMG_SEQ.gridX: 2D grid X data in meters (Nx,Ny)
%     IMG_SEQ.gridY: 2D grid Y data in meters (Nx,Ny)
%     IMG_SEQ.dx: X resolution in meters.
%     IMG_SEQ.dy: Y resolution in meters.
%     IMG_SEQ.dt: time resolution in seconds.
%     IMG_SEQ.ts_video: video time stamps in datenum format. 1xNt vector.
%     IMG_SEQ.altitude: altitude to the water surface in meters.
%                       altitude  = video altitude + offset_home2water_Z
%     IMG_SEQ.pitch: video pitch (for Nadir pitch = -90)
%     IMG_SEQ.roll: video roll (for Nadir roll = 0)
%     IMG_SEQ.heading: video heading to North (yaw)
%     IMG_SEQ.Longitude: video longitude in degrees
%     IMG_SEQ.Latitude: video latitude in degrees
%     IMG_SEQ.mediainfo_string: raw mediainfo string
%     IMG_SEQ.Georeference_Struct_config: Georeference_Struct used
