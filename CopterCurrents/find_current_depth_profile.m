function out = find_current_depth_profile(wavenumbers,Ux,Uy,waterDepth)

%This function finds the depth profile of the currents, using a number of
%various methods (could be added to in the future). All methods work from 
%{k,Ux,Uy} triplets obtained from a 3D wave spectrum. So far, most methods
%only work in infinite depth. 
%To date, the methods used are:

% 1) Effective depth method (EDM): depths Z_eff are assigned to each wavenumber value
%based on an assumption to the functional form of the current profile.
%Three options are performed:

    %Linear profile: Z_eff = -1/(2*k)

    %Logarithmic profile: Z_eff = -1/(3.56*k)

    %Phillips wind spectrum Stokes drift profile: Z_eff = -pi/(8*k)
    %See e.g. Ø. Breivik et al. 2016 A Stokes drift approximation based on the
    %Phillips spectrum. Ocean Modelling 100, 49-56.

%For each case above, the mapped velocities are used to approximate an
%appropriate depth profile based on the assumed functional form.


%2) Polynomial effective depth method (PEDM): The method is an extension of
%the EDM method assuming a linear profile in the mapping. The method then
%corrects the velocities at each depth assuming a polynomial form to the
%current profile.

%method for determining near-surface currents from wave dispersion measurements.

%INPUTS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%wavenumbers - values at which Doppler shift currents are measured [rad/m]
%Ux - doppler shift velocity in the x-direction [m/s]
%Uy - doppler shift velocity in the y-direction [m/s]

%waterDepth (optional): set to Inf by default. Only used for the EDM-linear
%and PEDM methods above

%OUTPUTS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%The function rotates the horizontal coordinate system to 'along-flow'
%and 'cross-flow' directions instead of 'x' and 'y' the output current
%profile are provided in this coordinate system, with rotation angle 'phi'
%to transform back to the input coordinate system.

%out.global.wavenumbers - wavenumbers used in the method, same as input unless some of the Ux, Uy input values are NaN's
%out.global.U1 - Doppler shifts in along-flow direction
%out.global.U2 - Doppler shifts in cross-flow direction
%out.phi - rotation angle to transform back input coordinate system:
    %Ux = U1(inds)*cos(phi) - U2(inds)*sin(phi);
    %Uy = U1(inds)*sin(phi) + U2(inds)*cos(phi);


%out.EDM - structure with following substructures: 'lin','log','Phillips'
%All have the following fields:
%Z_eff: effective depths
%U1_fun: depth profile function handle in along-flow direction (depths are negative values)
%U2_fun: depth profile function handle in cross-flow direction (depths are negative values)
%eps1: RMS difference between forward calculated Doppler shifts (using U1_fun) and U1 values
%eps2: RMS difference between forward calculated Doppler shifts (using U2_fun) and U2 values

%out.EDM.lin.Usurf1 - surface velocity based on linear profile fit
%out.EDM.lin.Shear1 - constant vertical shear (vorticity) based on linear profile fit

%out.EDM.log.uStar1 - friction velocity based on log fit
%out.EDM.Phillips.uWind1 - wind velocity based on Phillips spectrum profile Stokes drift profile fit

%The above fields out.EDM.***.***2 reflect the same quantities in the cross flow direction 

%out.PEDM.Z_eff: effective depths
%out.PEDM.U1_fun: depth profile function handle in along-flow direction (depths are negative values)
%out.PEDM.U2_fun: depth profile function handle in cross-flow direction (depths are negative values)
%out.PEDM.eps1: RMS difference between forward calculated Doppler shifts (using U1_fun) and U1 values
%out.PEDM.eps2: RMS difference between forward calculated Doppler shifts (using U2_fun) and U2 values
%out.PEDM.verbose1 - infomation about the PEDM fits in along-flow direction - see pedm.m for more information
%out.PEDM.verbose2 - infomation about the PEDM fits in cross-flow direction - see pedm.m for more information
