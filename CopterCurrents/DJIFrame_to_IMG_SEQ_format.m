function [IMG_SEQ_frame] = DJIFrame_to_IMG_SEQ_format(DJI_frame)
%   Transform DJI frame to IMG_SEQ_frame format. Two transformation are
%   needed:
%   - flip Y dimension
%   - permute dimension 1 by 2.  
%   Input:
%     DJI_frame: grey scale raw 2D Intensity image (Ny,Nx), extrated from   
%          DII video:
%          dim1 => Y (vertical) data. Monotonic descending.
%          dim2 => X (Horizontal) data. Monotonic ascending.
%
%
%   Output:
%     IMG_SEQ_frame: 2D matrix (Nx,Ny).
%          dim1 => X (Horizontal) data. Monotonic ascending.
%          dim2 => Y (vertical) data.  Monotonic ascending.
