% Input
%   Kx: wave number (vector or scalar) [rad/meter];
%   Ky: wave number (vector or scalar) [rad/meter];
%   Ux: Ux [m/s]. If Kx and Ky are vectors, then Ux must be a scalar;
%   Uy: Uy [m/s]. If Kx and Ky are vectors, then Uy must be a scalar;
%   water_depth: water depth in meters. If Kx and Ky are vectors, 
%                then water_depth must be a scalar;
%   Domain: +1 (positive domain) or -1 negative domain.
