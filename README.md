This is the first stable release: DISCO 1.00, for detailed 
installation instructions, see the file INSTALL.



1. DISCO <br />
================

DISCO is a set of tools designed to extract water surface 
current fields (flow speeds) from UAV videos.

The Disco current extraction is based in the wave disperion relation, 
and the complete process is described in following work:

M. Stre√üer, R. Carrasco and J. Horstmann, "Video-Based Estimation 
of Surface Currents Using a Low-Cost Quadcopter," in IEEE Geoscience 
and Remote Sensing Letters, vol. 14, no. 11, pp. 2027-2031, Nov. 2017.

The DISCO signal processing is dividing in 3 steps:

	1) Record a nadir video of the water surface by a  
	quadcopter with a camera gimbal.

	2) Video rectification: Georeference the video in real world coordenates, 
	and slice the video in serveral squared regions. 

	3) Fit the most probable current, applying the wave dispersion relation 
	in a spectral energy-based maximization technique, in every squared region.
