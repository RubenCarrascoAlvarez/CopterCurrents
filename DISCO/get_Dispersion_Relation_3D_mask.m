function [DS_3D_mask] = get_Dispersion_Relation_3D_mask(Spectrum, water_depth, Ux, Uy, w_width)
% Get dispersion realtion mask from according to water_depth, Ux, Uy and w_width
% Based in Filter3DMasking.m from Jose C. Nieto-Borge (28/06/2011)  
%
% Input:
%   Spectrum: Spectrum structure from retrieve_power_spectrum
%   water_depth: water depth in meters
%   Ux: current in x direction (dim 1) [m/s];
%   Uy: current in y direction (dim 2) [m/s];
%   w_width: filter width in [rad/sec]
%
% Output: 
%   DS_3D_mask: logic mask same size tham Spectrum.power_Spectrum, where is
%   set to 1 the areas corresponding to the dispersion relation
