function [DISCO_CamCalib] = CaltechCalibration2file(Caltech_calibration_filename, DISCO_calibration_filename,camera_offset_Z)
%   Translate Caltech calibration files (genrated by the 'Camera 
%   Calibration Toolbox for Matlab') to a DISCO calibration camera file.
%
%   Input:
%    Caltech_calibration_filename: calibration file generated my Caltech
%    matlab calibration GUI:
%
%     (http://www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib_doc/htmls/example.html)
%
%    DISCO_calibration_filename: DISCO camera calibration filename, where
%    the intrinsic camera parameters will be stored.
%    camera_offset_Z: distance in meters between the camera and drone 
%                     GPS antenna.
%
%   Output:
%       DISCO_CamCalib: DISCO Camera calibration structure.
%
%           DISCO_CamCalib.fc: focal length in pixels, 2x1 vector.
%           DISCO_CamCalib.cc: principal point coordinates, 2x1 vector.
%           DISCO_CamCalib.Skew coefficient: The skew coefficient defining
%               the angle  between the x and y pixel axes, 1x1 scalar, 
%               normally 0.
%       DISCO_CamCalib.Distortions: Image distortion coefficients
%           (radial and tangential distortions), 5x1 vector where:
%               kc(1) = k1 (radial distortion)
%               kc(2) = k2 (radial distortion)
%               kc(3) = p1 (tangencial distortion)
%               kc(4) = p2 (tangencial distortion)
%               kc(5) = k3 (radial distortion)
%       DISCO_CamCalib.nx: number of sensor pixels in horizontal direction. 
%       DISCO_CamCalib.ny: number of sensor pixels in vertical direction.
%       DISCO_CamCalib.camera_offset_Z: distance in meters between the
%               camera and drone GPS antenna.
%       DISCO_CamCalib.source: Calibration source used.
