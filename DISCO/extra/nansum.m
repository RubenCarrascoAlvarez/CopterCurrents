function [DATA_sum] = nansum(DATA,dim)
% Retrieve sum in dimemsion 'dim' of the matrix 'DATA', removing the 
% NaN data first. 
%
% Input:
%    DATA: matrix data
%    dim: dimension to average.
%
% Output:
%    DATA_sum: Average data.
%
% Note: this function is similar to the nansum function provided by Matlab
%       in the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
%
