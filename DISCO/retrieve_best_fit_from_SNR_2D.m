% Retrieve best fit from SNR 2D maps.
%
%   Input:
%       SNR_2D: signal to noise ration matrix 
%       Ux_2D: 2D Ux matrix corresponding to SNR_2D
%       Uy_2D: 2D Uy matrix corresponding to SNR_2D
%       method: method to find the best fit
%               0 => maximum Signal to Noise Ratio
%               1 => Not implemented yet.
%
%   Output:
%       Ux: Best fit for Ux 
%       Uy: Best fit for Uy 
%       SNR_max: SNR corresponding to the best fit.
%       lin_ind: 2D matrix linear index corresponding to the best fit.
