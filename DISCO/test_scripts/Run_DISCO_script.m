% Run_DISCO_script.m
%
% Run DISCO performing the current fit from a video in 5 steps:
%
% 1. Record a nadir video of the water surface by a quad-copter with a camera
% gimbal. The camera must point perpendicular to the water (nadir) and the
% Drone must be static. A 30 seconds video is enough. The Drone altitude
% is stored in the video metadata.
%
% 2. Video rectification: The images from the video are rectified to in real world
% coordinates.
%
% 3. Slice the rectified video in several squared regions, and set the fit parame-
% ters.
%
% 4. Fit the most probable current, applying the wave dispersion relation (a
% spectral energy-based maximization technique) in every squared region.
%
% 5. Filter obtained currents with Signal to Noise Ratio, and plot currents
% in Camera reference grid or UTM coordinates.
